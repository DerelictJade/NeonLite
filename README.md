## Installation & Usage

1. Download [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest) and install it onto your `Neon White.exe`.
2. Run the game once. This will create required folders; you should see a splash screen if you installed the modloader correctly.
3. Download this version of [Melon Preferences Manager](https://github.com/Bluscream/MelonPreferencesManager/releases/download/1.3.1/MelonPrefManager.Mono.dll), and move it into the mods folder of your Neon White install (e.g. `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Neon White\Mods`)
4. Download the latest version of [UniverseLib](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UniverseLib/releases/download/1.5.1/UniverseLib.Mono.zip), unpack it and move the .dll file into your Neon White mods folder as in the previous step.
5. Download the `NeonLite.dll` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Faustas156/NeonLite/releases) and drop it in the mods folder.
6. Once it's all working, press F5 in-game to change the settings for the mod.

### Additional Notes

Unless you're a mod developer, make sure to add `--melonloader.hideconsole` to your game launch properties (right click the game in steam -> properties -> launch options at the bottom of that window) to hide the console that melonloader loads in. It makes your game boot up faster xd

Use `-neonlite_disable_discord` as start argument on Steam to disable discord integration entirely, if you ever happen to run into any issues with the game.
