# NeonLite 
 The Quality of Life Mod for All Your Neon White needs!

Still currently a work in progress and thus it only features a limited amount of mods.

This version of NeonLite is currently suspended due to my lack of interest in developing the mod. May come back in the future.. possibly..

New up-to-date version of NeonLite maintained by MOPSKATER (also has helped with development of the mod): [here! NeonLite v2](https://github.com/MOPSKATER/NeonLite)

**[current version: v1.4.2 | dev build version: pre-1.5.0]**

## Installation & Usage

1. Download [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest) and install it onto your `Neon White.exe`.
2. Run the game once. This will create required folders; you should see a splash screen if you installed the modloader correctly.
3. Download this version of [Melon Preferences Manager](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/991005812094799922/1109821695805640744/melonprefsmanager.rar), and put the .dlls from that zip into the `mods` folder of your Neon White install (e.g. `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Neon White\Mods`)
4. Download the `NeonLite.dll` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Faustas156/NeonLite/releases/) and drop it in the mods folder.
5. Once it's all working, press F5 in-game to change the settings for the mod.

## SPECIAL CREDITS:

* [MOPSKATER](https://github.com/MOPSKATER) for helping with 90% of the mods here. :)
* [Pandora's Fox](https://github.com/PandorasFox), i borrowed some of her code for the Remove "Start Mission" button mod. 

### Additional Notes

Unless you're a mod developer, make sure to add `--melonloader.hideconsole` to your game launch properties (right click the game in steam -> properties -> launch options at the bottom of that window) to hide the console that melonloader loads in. It makes your game boot up faster xd
